3 - The Teams class does implement the __len__ method, and the classmates instance can 
    utilize it.

4 - Interfaces refer to the public methods of an object that users, such as developers, 
    access to interact with an object. Examples of interfaces include getter and setter methods. 
    Implementation refers to the inner workings of an object that are hidden from the user. 
    Examples of implementation include private variables and methods, such as helper methods 
    for the public interface methods. The inner code of a public method can also be considered 
    implementation because it is abstracted away from the user. 

5 â€“ I would design an interface structure for a storage system that works with a variety of 
    storage devices by using polymorphism. Specifically, I would have a consistent public 
    interface with different underlying implementations that handle storing data in the 
    different storage devices.
